- 👋 Hi, I’m Christopher @Dinosaure7.
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my skills as a web developper.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript/React, Express/Node, Git/GitHub and more
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, I am studying in a boot camp, and will take a web developper degree exam in about 2 months.
- We are working on our graduation project at the moment, we are done with the backlog; the modelisation, the framework and started coding.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can send an email at vintageinfini@yahoo.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Everything is fun, it's merely a set of mind :)
